Lists and Dictionaries

## Task
Imagine you are running a cafe. Create a new Python file in your folder called cafe.py.
1. Create a list called menu, which should contain at least four items sold in the cafe.
2. Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock value for each item on your menu.
3. Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for each item on your menu.
4. Next, calculate the total_stock worth in the cafe. You will need to remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do this.
4. Finally, print out the result of your calculation.
